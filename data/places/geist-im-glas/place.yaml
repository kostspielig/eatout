   The beauty of these plates is just breathtaking, the difficult part here is
   just to decide for one of them. We tried the **huevos rancheros** and the
   **buttermilk pancakes** and it was a success.

   The pancakes have the perfect consistency, soft, thick, light and fluffy
   in the right amount. The dulce the leche on top is as good as I can remember
   from Spain, it is great to finally find it here in Berlin (for those who do
   not know, it is just boiled sweet condensed milk until paradise).

   The eggs in mexican style are also delicious, although we were not able to
   finish both plates, in the end it can be very heavy. The only downside is
   the coffee: they only have american coffee, not real espresso. Instead I
   would recommend to try one of their cocktails instead, maybe the gazpacho
   with a twist.
