   Delicious coffee and nice pastries is what you can expect from this charming
   coffee place in Kreuzberg. The coffee has an intense yet sharp flavour that makes
   it delicious without sugar. The staff is very friendly and explains in detail
   extense coffee selection that changes every week.

   It is located next to **Marheineke Markthalle**, and on saturdays there is a nice
   small **flea market** that is worth visiting since it is not as crowded and expensive as
   Mauer Park.
