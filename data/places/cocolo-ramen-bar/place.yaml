description: |
  Cocolo is the place for Ramen in Berlin, period.  Their owners run
  another ramen shop and a [sushi restaurant in
  Mitte](http://kuchi.de/?r=cocolo-xberg) and they have proven over
  the years to be the masters of this exquisite Japanese soup.

  The kitchen is situated directly behind the bar, so you can enjoy
  watching the skillful preparation of your dish, in an almost
  choreographed dance of steam and noodles.  The venue in Mitte
  *looks* a bit more authentic---it is really small, reminding you of
  the tightness of Tokyo---but the food is excellent in either and the
  Kreuzberg one has a nice terrace to enjoy a spring soup.  The
  selection of sauces and toppings is not exhuberant but it is
  carefully designed, preventing us from getting distracted from the
  most important thing: the soup, the handmade noodles, and the care
  and skill involved in making it.  Recommended.
