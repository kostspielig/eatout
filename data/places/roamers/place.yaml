  It is the second time this month that we tried this little charming place in pannierstraße,
  the first time around it was super packed and many people was waiting to sit. When this happens
  or we either get a reservation for another day or we just leave. I think it is great that
  to find a new place, and if you read amazing reviews of course you want to go, but honestly,
  life is too short to keep waiting for lunch.

  So this time (Saturday at 5 pm), we found a table inside in the first try. Let me tell you,
  all the food in this place looked amazing. Brunch style, with **huevos rancheros**, **eggs benedict**
  and many other delicious plates on the menu, but since we already had late lunch we decided to go
  only for dessert.

  The carrot cake with seeds its definitely worth trying, good coffe and nice smoothies and lemonades.
  What else can we ask for? Well, I will let you know next time I go there.
