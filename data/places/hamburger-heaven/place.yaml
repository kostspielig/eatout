  Located at the busy crossing between Graeferstraße, Kotbusser Brücke
  and Maybachufer, this little burger shop leaves no room for
  disappointment.  The meat (with bio options) is just well made, fat
  and juicy without over the top deluxe premium bullshit.  The fries,
  rough and natural are perfectly on point, and the homemade ketchup
  and mayo are simply delicious---we always end up just dipping the
  fingers!  A simple, well executed and fairly priced offer: the
  perfect balance that warms our foodie hearts.  It has become one of
  our favourite places to go on a sunny saturday.  Very much
  recommended!
