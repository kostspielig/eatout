  The vision of Restlos Glücklich is that food surplus is more valued
  again.  They are in direct contact with supermarkets and whole sellers
  in order to get the products they can no longer sell, mainly
  vegetables, fruit and bread.

  Food surplus does not mean that this is already spoiled or that the
  “best before” date has passed.  It is truly an unfortunate fact that
  a lot of food is discarded, because it simply takes away storage
  space, the shape is not right or just the packaging is damaged.

  Their menu depends on the food they can get that day, so you never
  know what you are going to find.
