title: Proper Chinese dumplings
description: |
  We tried soup dumplings (or
  [Xialongbao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolongbao)) for the
  first time in a business trip in Seattle.  These are steamed
  dumplings, often filled with hot soup and heavily spiced minced meat
  or other ingredients.  As you bite it, the hot soup floods your
  mouth, filling it with flavor that evolves as it takes over your
  papillae.  An erotic gastromonic experience.

  We wanted to indulge ourselves in these little pleasures here in
  Berlin too, and eventually found where to: Shaniu's House of
  Noodles.  As its name suggests, this place is great at everything
  that has to do with rice flour: noodles and dumplings are all great.
  You can also find here other Chinese delights that you can rarely
  find in more westernized shops, like these spicy chicken feet or
  pork belly soup. This is definitelly a place that we try to visit
  whenever we are in Wilmersdorf: very much recommended!
